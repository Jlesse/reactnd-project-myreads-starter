# MyReads Project
## About This Project
This is my submission for the udacity react program, "MyReads" Project. This app allows the user to keep a Library of books sorted into 3 categories: "Currently Reading", "Want To Read", and "Read". The user can move books between these categories, or "shelves". The user may also search for new books on the search page, and add books returned by the search to any of their shelves.
## How To Run
Just open up the terminal and run npm install, and then npm start. The app will open up on localhost:3000.
